- Finish scrolling -> selecting timetamp with higher index then last one (outside viewport)
- Add info box when clicking on info button
- Add method to search for units/entities, commands or steps
- Add way to filter out things:
    Select filter on <checkbox> <text input>
        unit = xxx (miss zelfs meerdere zoals 123, 234, 345)
        command = xxx
        step = xxx
        state = xxx (etc)
    This will show only the timestamps that have these filters specified
